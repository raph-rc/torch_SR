# torch_SR

A PyTorch reimplementation of the non-local-means (NLM) MRI super-resolution
algorithm of Manjon et al. (2010), with a C-backed reference path ported
from the authors' original Matlab/MEX code and a pure-PyTorch, GPU-capable
path. The package also exposes the individual NLM regularization and
noise-estimation stages as standalone command-line tools, for denoising or
parameter inspection independent of the upsampling pipeline.

## Algorithm

The pipeline (`sr.core.nlm_upsample` / `sr_pytorch.core.nlm_upsample`)
follows five stages:

1. Normalize the input volume's intensities onto `[0, 256]`.
2. Build an initial high-resolution estimate by placing each low-resolution
   sample at its corresponding high-resolution block centre and filling the
   rest with cubic B-spline interpolation (`sr.interpolate.initial_interpolation`).
3. Estimate a per-voxel noise level from the local intensity variance.
4. Iteratively regularize the high-resolution estimate with a non-local-means
   update — a weighted average over a `(2v+1)³` search neighbourhood of
   `(2f+1)³` patches, weighted by patch similarity and the estimated noise —
   with block-mean preservation against the low-resolution input, until a
   convergence-ratio threshold (`--tol`) or a maximum iteration count is
   reached.
5. Rescale back to the input's original intensity range.

Two interchangeable backends implement stage 4:

- **`c`** (`sr.core`, `sr.regularize`): the CFFI-compiled, MEX-free port of
  the original per-voxel C kernel. Used as the numerical reference for the
  PyTorch path.
- **`pytorch`** (`sr_pytorch.core`, `sr_pytorch.regularize`): a
  GPU-capable reimplementation that vectorizes the search over offsets with
  `avg_pool3d` rather than looping per voxel. Defaults to `float32` on CUDA
  and `float64` on CPU (matching the C reference); the noise/local-std
  helpers use reflect-padded `avg_pool3d`, matching
  `scipy.ndimage.uniform_filter(mode='reflect')`.

A third, **experimental** method, `optimize` (`sr_pytorch.optimize`), skips
the closed-form NLM iteration and instead optimizes an additive
high-resolution correction field with Adam against a downsample-consistency
objective. It is documented as slower than the `pytorch` method and not
better in PSNR, and is not selected by default.

## Installation

From `upsample/`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt        # torch, numpy, scipy, cffi

# Build the C extension (once; produces sr/_nlm_core.*.so)
python sr/_nlm_build.py

# Build the vendored EZminc oracle extensions (once; needs GSL, the
# toolkit's static FFTW, and an installed MINC toolkit). Only required
# for the oracle-comparison tests (test_ezminc_backend.py, test_dwt.py,
# test_noise_estimate.py).
python _legacy/build_legacy.py
```

`minc2-simple` (MINC2 volume I/O) is a git submodule; initialize it with
`git submodule update --init` if it is not already populated. The `pytorch`
method and the standalone denoising/regularization/noise-estimation CLIs
work without the C extension; `--method c` (or its default selection when
the extension is present) requires it.

## Usage

All commands are run from `upsample/` and operate on MINC2 (`.mnc`) volumes.

**`upsample.py`** — full super-resolution pipeline:

```bash
python upsample.py input.mnc output.mnc --factors 2 1 1 --method pytorch
```

Key options: `--factors FZ FY FX` (integer upsampling factors, numpy `Z Y X`
axis order, default `2 1 1`), `--method c|pytorch|optimize` (default: `c` if
built, else `pytorch`), `--v`/`--f` (search radius / patch half-size),
`--tol` (convergence ratio, default `1.2`), `--max-iter`, `--initial-only`
(spline interpolation only, no NLM), `--device`, `--n-steps`/`--lr` (for
`--method optimize`), `--verbose`.

**`denoise.py`** — single NLM pass, exposing `sr_pytorch.regularize.regularize`
directly: plain denoising by default, or regularization of an already
spline-interpolated volume when given `--factors`:

```bash
python denoise.py hr.mnc hr_denoised.mnc --strength 2.0
python denoise.py hr.mnc hr_reg.mnc --factors 2 1 1
```

The noise level comes from exactly one of four mutually exclusive flags:
`--auto-sigma-global` (one uniform level from `sr_pytorch.noise_estimate`,
**the default** when none is given), `--auto-sigma-voxel` (a per-voxel
local-variance estimate), `--sigma VALUE` (that uniform level) or
`--sigma-file FILE` (a per-voxel noise map as a MINC2 volume). `--gauss`
switches the automatic uniform estimate from Rician (default) to Gaussian.

`--strength` scales the noise level however it was obtained (`0` is the
identity). `--floor-mode legacy|scale` selects the fixed noise floor
(`legacy`, default) or one derived from the volume's dynamic range (`scale`,
affine-equivariant). `--factors FZ FY FX` are the upsampling factors the
input was interpolated with; the block-mean correction is enabled
automatically whenever they are not `1 1 1`, and `--no-mean-preserve` forces
it off. Combining `--mean-preserve` with `--factors 1 1 1` is rejected: every
block would be a single voxel, so the correction would restore the input
exactly and discard the filtering pass.

**`noise_estimate.py`** — Rician/Gaussian noise-level or SNR estimate:

```bash
python noise_estimate.py input.mnc --snr --verbose
```

Prints the noise level by default, the SNR with `--snr`, both with
`--noise --snr`; `--mask` overrides the built-in k-means object detection;
`--bins` sets the histogram bin count (default `2000`); `--gauss` selects
the Gaussian noise model.

## Testing

```bash
cd upsample
pytest tests/
```

Tests requiring the C extension or the EZminc oracle extensions skip
automatically when those are not built. `pytest tests/test_core.py -v` runs
a single file; `pytest --cov=sr tests/` reports coverage. `data/psnr_factor_*.npz`
are the fixed regression fixtures used by `test_psnr.py`, generated by
`scripts/generate_test_blocks.py`; `scripts/benchmark_sr.py` reports PSNR
and wall-clock time for the `c` and `pytorch` backends against them.

## License and provenance

`COPYING.NLM` documents the code's provenance in detail. In summary:

- `upsample/sr/nlm_core.c` is a direct, MEX-free port of the original
  GPL-licensed C kernel, `cMRegularizarNLM3D_V2.c`.
- `upsample/sr_pytorch/regularize.py` is an independent PyTorch
  reimplementation of the same computation — whole-volume tensor operations
  rather than a per-voxel loop — and differs from the C kernel by
  convention as well as by expression: the C kernel uses the first voxel's
  sigma and local mean for both directions of a symmetric update, while
  this implementation uses each centre's own.
- Both are derivatives of the GPL-licensed original by descent.
- `upsample/_legacy/ezminc/` is separately licensed vendored code (Coupé et
  al.'s EZminc project); see `upsample/_legacy/ezminc/README.md` for its
  own provenance and license notes.

There is no repository-wide license file; anyone redistributing this
repository should resolve licensing against these per-file notices first.
